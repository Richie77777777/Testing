        <h2>Appetizers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bruschetta</li>

        
            <p>Bruschetta is an Italian antipasto consisting of grilled bread often topped with olive oil and salt. Most commonly it's served with toppings of tomato, vegetables, beans, cured meat, and/or cheese. In Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill.</p>

            <li>Fried Calamari</li>
            
            <p>Squid is eaten in many cuisines; in English, the culinary name calamari is often used for squid dishes. There are many ways to prepare and cook squid. Fried squid is common in the Mediterranean. In New Zealand, Australia, the United States, Canada, and South Africa, it is sold in fish and chip shops, and steakhouses. </p>

            <li>Caprese Salad</li>
            
            <p>Caprese salad is an Italian salad, made of sliced fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, and olive oil. It is usually arranged on a plate in restaurant practice. Like pizza Margherita, it features the colours of the Italian flag: green, white, and red.</p>

        <h2>Main Courses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Grilled Salmon with Lemon Butter</li>
            
            <p>This grilled salmon tastes so good! A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets. Even my 9-year-old loves this recipe! Serve with a side of grilled zucchini or grilled corn.</p>
            <li>Chicken Alfredo Pasta</li>
            
            <p> Our American Chicken Alfredo pasta does use heavy cream as the base for the sauce, which helps the Parmesan melt in smoothly instead of clumping or sticking to the bottom of the pan. Most other dairy products or dairy substitutes contain too much water to allow the cheese to melt into the sauce properly</p>

            <li>Steak Frites</li>
            <p>Steak frites, meaning "steak [and] fries" in French, is a dish consisting of steak paired with French fries. It is commonly served in European brasseries, and is considered by some to be the national dish of Belgium, which claims to be the place of its invention.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Desserts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New York Cheesecake</li>
            <p>This recipe makes a classic New York-style cheesecake with a buttery graham cracker crust and rich, dense filling made from cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla, a hint of lemon, and a few tablespoons of flour.</p>

            <li>Molten Chocolate Lava Cake</li>
            <p>Molten chocolate cake is a French dessert that consists of a chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate core. It is named for that molten center, and it is also known as mi-cuit au chocolat, chocolat coulant, chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake.</p>
            <li>Tiramisu</li>
            <p>Tiramisu is an Italian dessert made of ladyfinger pastries dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar and mascarpone and flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts</p>
